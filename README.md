# Asterisk of Shame 

This extension searches web pages for the names of the 147 Republican congresspeople who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, and when found, adds a simple asterisk "*" to their name. This is a reference to the phrase "asterisk of shame" that is sometimes used to when describing how people will be remembered in the history books. 

The intention is to provide contextual information that is part of the public record about a matter of public importance, and not to encourage harassment of any kind. 

## Installation

This extension is pending review by Google for inclusion in the Chrome Web Store. You can install it manually by downloading it and turning on "developer mode" in the extension settings for Chrome, and then selecting "install unpackaged extension." Some [instructions can be found here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/#unpacked).

## Roadmap 

I have no plans to significantly change the functionality of this extension. I had considered making the asterisk red, but that opens the door to formatting and style issues with different text and background colors. I will likely port the extension to Firefox when I have a chance.
